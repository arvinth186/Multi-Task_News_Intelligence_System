Since the 2016 campaign, members on both sides on the aisle have become increasingly hostile towards one another. This also the case for college students experiencing being a part of the political process for the first time. According to exit polls from our most recent presidential election, 18 to 29-year-olds voted for Hillary Clinton 55 percent of the time, Trump 37 percent of the time and abstained or voted for a third party candidate only eight percent of the time. While these voting records indicate that college-age individuals likely lean Democratic as a majority, the 37 percent indicates that there are plenty of young Americans who do not fall into the political norm of their age group. Stacker looked at Niche data in order to list the most conservative colleges in America, along with their acceptance rates and the average cost per student (with financial aid taken into consideration).

One bad swing cost Patrick Cantlay the early lead Thursday at the Travelers Championship. Cantlay was cruising along at 6 under when he reached the par-3 8 th , his second to last hole of the day. Bogey-free to that point, Cantlay ended up making double after his tee ball came up 30 yards short of the flag   and in the water. \\\"Just hit it a little fat, and it's got to get up in the air to get the wind,\\\" he explained. \\\"It was downwind and didn't get the wind because I hit it fat and it went in the water.\\\" A closing par left him to sign for 4-under 66, two off the pace through the early wave. Full-field scores from the Travelers Championship Travelers Championship: Articles, photos and videos Considering the season he's had to date, it's become more of a surprise when Cantlay isn't hanging around the lead. In 15 starts, he's racked up eight top-10s, including two thirds, a runner-up, and his second PGA Tour victory earlier this month at the Memorial. TPC River Highlands should also bring back some fond memories for Cantlay, who as a 19-year-old freshman at UCLA took the Day 2 lead here in 2011 with a then-course-record round of 60. \\\"I definitely look back here on that round with fond memories,\\\" he said. \\\"It was like only my second tour event and I wasn't really expecting to come out and shoot a score like that. \\\"But, yeah, it's nice to come back to a place where you've had success. I definitely feel comfortable around here. It's one of the only golf courses I think I get on the first tee at the beginning of the day and think I can birdie every hole.

Since the 2016 campaign, members on both sides on the aisle have become increasingly hostile towards one another. This also the case for college students experiencing being a part of the political process for the first time. According to exit polls from our most recent presidential election, 18 to 29-year-olds voted for Hillary Clinton 55 percent of the time, Trump 37 percent of the time and abstained or voted for a third party candidate only eight percent of the time. While these voting records indicate that college-age individuals likely lean Democratic as a majority, the 37 percent indicates that there are plenty of young Americans who do not fall into the political norm of their age group. Stacker looked at Niche data in order to list the most conservative colleges in America, along with their acceptance rates and the average cost per student (with financial aid taken into consideration).

One bad swing cost Patrick Cantlay the early lead Thursday at the Travelers Championship. Cantlay was cruising along at 6 under when he reached the par-3 8 th , his second to last hole of the day. Bogey-free to that point, Cantlay ended up making double after his tee ball came up 30 yards short of the flag   and in the water. \\\"Just hit it a little fat, and it's got to get up in the air to get the wind,\\\" he explained. \\\"It was downwind and didn't get the wind because I hit it fat and it went in the water.\\\" A closing par left him to sign for 4-under 66, two off the pace through the early wave. Full-field scores from the Travelers Championship Travelers Championship: Articles, photos and videos Considering the season he's had to date, it's become more of a surprise when Cantlay isn't hanging around the lead. In 15 starts, he's racked up eight top-10s, including two thirds, a runner-up, and his second PGA Tour victory earlier this month at the Memorial. TPC River Highlands should also bring back some fond memories for Cantlay, who as a 19-year-old freshman at UCLA took the Day 2 lead here in 2011 with a then-course-record round of 60. \\\"I definitely look back here on that round with fond memories,\\\" he said. \\\"It was like only my second tour event and I wasn't really expecting to come out and shoot a score like that. \\\"But, yeah, it's nice to come back to a place where you've had success. I definitely feel comfortable around here. It's one of the only golf courses I think I get on the first tee at the beginning of the day and think I can birdie every hole.

The Rock took to Instagram to gush about his 17-year-old first-born baby girl, whose mom is his ex-wife and current manager, Dany Garcia, and reveal that Simone is going to New York University in the fall. \\\"And then your babies graduate,\\\" the proud dad wrote alongside a photo slideshow in which he embraces Simone in her cap and gown -- and in which she tries to squirm away from his affections as he showers her with love in a second pic. \\\"Very proud of my first daughter daughter graduating high school, kickin' a-- and is now NYU bound.

One of her other famous clients, Superman actor Henry Cavill, sent his congratulations to Simone in the comments. Fans also commented on how much they loved Simone's graduation cap -- a tribute to Marvel characters Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes' lasting friendship in the form of half of each man's shield. Simone took to Instagram herself to post a photo with bestie Paulina Blasi in which both are wearing their customized Captain America-Winter Soldier caps. It's captioned with the beautiful quote from the Marvel films, \\\"I'm with you till the end of the line.\\\" Dwayne also has two young daughters with girlfriend Lauren Hashian: 3-year-old Jasmine and 1-year-old Tiana. Celeb kids all grown up: What they look like now:\",\n          \"UPDATE: A significant weather alert has been issued for Miami-Dade and Broward counties Thursday afternoon. South Florida is in a pattern of strong-to-severe thunderstorms through the weekend   with some potential accompanying wind gusts up to 60 mph. At 12:30 p.m. Thursday, the National Weather Service in Miami issued a significant weather advisory for coastal, inland and metro areas of Miami-Dade until 1:15 p.m.. due to the threat of gusty winds and small hail. But the downpours could have one possible health benefit. They may keep us from coughing from a large Saharan dust plume expected to blanket much of the Atlantic through Friday and spread into the Caribbean over the weekend and into early next week, according to CBS4 meteorologist Craig Setzer. People with respiratory issues in the Caribbean ought to be aware, he said. The leading edge of the Saharan dust cloud could edge in the direction of the South Florida coast over the weekend but break off before affecting the area, according to satellite maps at Fox 13. The Saharan dust layer will merit watching into the week, though, to determine its potential effect on the mainland U.S. The Saharan dust also tamps down tropical storm development in the Atlantic. Tropical cyclone activity is not expected for the next two days, the National Hurricane Center reports. Back to South Florida: The National Weather Service in Miami issued a hazardous weather outlook to note that, once again, our afternoons will be marked by strong to severe thunderstorms and their usual byproducts. That likely means \\\"frequent to excessive lightning,\\\" along with gusty winds, hail that could be nickel-sized in spots along the east coast metro areas, funnel clouds, and heavy rainfall. The strongest storms Thursday afternoon could produce wind gusts in excess of 45 mph. But a few of these storms could give off gusts up to 60 mph   likely faster than you'll be traveling on Florida's Turnpike this afternoon if the predictions come to fruition. Chances of showers and thunderstorms increase to 60% chance Friday and Saturday and dip a bit to 50% on Sunday in Miami-Dade and Broward. But the Florida Keys   from Key Largo to Key West   also is looking at storm chances of 50% this weekend. Temperatures will be in the upper 80s.     \\u00a92019 Miami Herald Visit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
