Attorneys for Derek Almena and Max Harris, the two men being held responsible for the deaths of 36 people, are trying to show that others also played a significant role in the tragedy. The first witness was a woman named Sharon Evans. She testified she was at a nearby taco restaurant as the fire was raging and said she overheard a group of young men happily congratulating each other about what they had just done. \\\"They were talking about the way the fire was going\\u2026nobody was ever going to be able to make it out. Nobody was ever going to be able to escape,\\\" said Tyler Smith, attorney for defendant Max Harris. \\\"She says she heard approximately five of these men making these comments. They were all dressed in black, wearing black hoodies. This is what the witness says\\u2026this isn't something the defense is making up.\\\" The defense is alleging arsonists intentionally set the fire. Their second witness was Michael Russell who lived in the Ghost Ship and barely escaped the fire. He testified he saw a couple of men he didn't recognize in dark clothing running for the exit shortly after the fire began. \\\"He said it was, he thought, two or three males based on their build,\\\" Smith said. \\\"So, that's consistent with what Ms. Evans overheard.\\\" Russell also testified that he heard a woman in a red beanie and green dress yelling to others not to go downstairs\\u2026which turned out to be the only real escape route. The defense is hoping if it can show the actions of others contributed to the tragedy, it will break the liability of Almena and Harris for creating the dangerous space and inviting people into it. But Colleen Dolan lost her daughter Chelsea in the fire and says none of the legal wrangling should absolve the two men of their responsibility. \\\"It should not have been built in the first place,\\\" Dolan said. \\\"It doesn't matter if it was 'beautiful' or 'awesome' or anything else. It doesn't matter how the fire started. The fact is it went up like a torch. It went up like a Burning Man structure\\u2026which is what they excelled in building in that Ghost Ship.\\\" There will be no testimony Tuesday. There are some procedural matters for the court to handle. But defense attorneys say, in days to come, they will likely call city officials to the stand to try to establish that they knew about the dangerous conditions and did nothing. The Ghost Ship fire occurred on the night of December 2nd, 2016, and remains the single most deadly structure fire in Oakland history.\",\n          \"You're one coat of paint away from the happiest home ever.

Creamsicle, lilac, light peach - pile 'em all in to a room, but try adding a contrasting dark shade, like the navy here, in various places like on pillows or in artwork. 3) Celery Look no further than Benjamin Moore's Guilford Green on your bedroom walls to achieve that serene feeling the second you wake up in the morning.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9392,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"LOS ANGELES A look at the status of the major figures in the life and death of Michael Jackson after 10 years, starting with the King of Pop himself: ___ MICHAEL JACKSON: Jackson, who would be 60 years old were he alive, was rehearsing for a tour intended to rehabilitate his career, finances and image when he died at age 50 of an overdose of the anesthetic propofol on June 25, 2009.

Deerfield Beach is home to a fishing pier, so much of the waste they collected was related to that activity; lead fishing weights alone contributed 1600 pounds to their haul. The group broke the previous record for largest underwater cleanup set by a team of 614 divers in the Red Sea four years ago. Now that divers have beautified that patch of ocean, the city of Deerfield Beach plans to dispose of the waste properly and recycle as much of it as possible.\",\n          \"The new law requires owners, employees or operators of tanning facilities to verify the age of anyone using a tanning device.

Most Dangerous Vacation Destinations Traveling is often \n","<sos> The following list is based on travel alerts and warnings issued by the U.S. Department of State and the UK Foreign Office, as well as the GPI. However, tourists are advised to avoid all non-essential travel to the Sulu Archipelago and through the southern Sulu Sea, and to exercise extreme caution when traveling to the island of Mindanao, due to continued terrorist threats, insurgent activities and kidnappings, according to the Department of State. Honduras Honduras is one of the most beautiful countries in Central America but the level of crime and violence remains critically high although it has declined in the past two years, according to a Travel Warning issued by the State Department. But the State Department strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to North Korea due to the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under the country's system of law enforcement, which imposes unduly harsh sentences, including for actions that in the U.S. would not be considered crimes. <eos>\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# ============================================================\n","# 3.
