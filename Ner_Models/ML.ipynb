       "\"Only FIVE internationals allowed, count em, FIVE! So first off we should say, per our usual Atlanta United lineup predictions, this will be wrong. Why will it be wrong? Well, aside from the obvious, we still don't have a ton of data points from Frank de Boer in how he prefers to rotate his team for   let's be honest   an inferior competition. We've seen how he rotates (or doesn't rotate) in CONCACAF Champions League play, but that's a bit different because CCL was clearly a priority for the club. We got one glimpse of U.S. Open Cup rotation last week when the team played a home game as the visiting team against the Charleston Battery, but will things change on the actual road against an MLS club? Here's my predicted lineup: Let's talk about it: Kann - Seems like he's the Cup keeper. Simples. CBs - I think Leandro Gonzalez Pirez is likely to be a casualty of the 5-international player limit. Miles Robinson is still young and probably isn't in need of much rest, and as far as international players go, you probably want those to be your most indispensable and/or attacking options in case things go awry. Florentin Pogba is still a fitness concern in his ability to go 90 minutes, but considering he started the last match and then was subbed out for tactical reasons before the 90 minutes were up, I think he'll be okay. LB: This could also be Mikey Ambrose instead of Michael Parkhurst. Brek Shea will almost certainly be rested after putting in a major shift last Thursday. RB: Not a ton of other options here, and I'd think de Boer will want to see an improved performance from Escobar. Also, I think he may want to continue to pair Escobar and Pity down the right flank to allow them to continue to build a playing relationship. CM: Eric Remedi could start here for either CM. But based on Frank de Boer's stated preference on not chopping and changing between matches, I'm leaving the CMs consistent from what we saw last week. AM: Again, shooting for consistency here, but I think inserting Meram of Pereira makes sense. Pereira has struggled in his last couple outings relative to some glimpses we've seen. Pereira is also an international, and if de Boer wants to include Ezequiel Barco on the bench, he will need to shed one of his internationals from the last squad. ST: We could very well see Brandon Vazquez here, primarily down to fitness concerns. Romario Williams gutted out 120 minutes last Thursday and finished the game holding his groin, but he trained with the team fully on Monday. Vazquez came on as a sub and scored twice, but part of me thinks de Boer will want to give his backup striker as many opportunities as possible to prove his worth. With three internationals in the starting lineup, I think Eric Remedi and Ezequiel Barco will round out the five maximum allowed. What do you think? Let us know in the comments.\""

       "'From apple cider vinegar shots to collagen in coffee , you know a health trend when you see one. Not all are created equal, but it\\'s fun to test them all out   and will them to make you a more vibrant and well human. But as we drink, eat, slurp, and chug different tonics in the hopes of becoming healthier, we could be overlooking an important piece of our health. Our dental health. Dr. Brian Kantor, DDS, a cosmetic dentist at Lowenberg Lituchy & Kantor , says our mouths are more connected to the rest of our bodies than we realize. Here are some health trends he says may take a toll on our teeth, gums, and overall mouth health. Apple Cider Vinegar There are all kinds of rumors going around about this sour and affordable elixir. \"Experts\" and brands tout that it can boost weight loss, and lower blood sugar   although the University of Chicago Medical Center wrote that many of those claims were myths . But taking shots of ACV also may be hurting our teeth. \"Apple cider vinegar is acidic and can erode enamel,\" Kantor says. Juice Cleanses Most nutritionists will tell you that it\\'s better to stick to a consistent, healthy diet than to go on a crash juice cleanse . And, evidently, so will dentists. \"I\\'ve seen an increase in decay, even with those who have good home care habits and see their dentist twice a year,\" Kantor says. \"The juice seems to sit at the junction where the tooth meets the gum and in between teeth, so flossing and brushing right after drinking juice is very important.\" Basically, the sugar from juice can wear away tooth enamel and ultimately cause cavities. The bacteria can also irritate the gums and eventually could lead to gum disease. \"There is a direct association between having an inflammatory response in your mouth, such as gum disease, to having an inflammatory response in the rest of the body, such as heart attack,\" Kantor says. Yikes. If you must juice, Kantor recommends drinking from a straw to keep the juice away from the surface of the teeth, and brushing your teeth 45 minutes after drinking. \"Cranberry and lime can be so acidic and temporarily soften the enamel,\" he says. \"So you don\\'t want to brush your teeth while they are in this softer state. This way, the acid won\\'t eat through and the sugar won\\'t cause cavities.\" Another tip for juicing: Dilute it with water so it\\'s less concentrated when it hits your mouth. Nondairy Milk Many of us have made the switch from dairy milk to almond, coconut, cashew, or oat milk. There are perks to these milk alternatives, especially if you have a lactose intolerance or avoid dairy for ethical reasons. But it\\'s important to choose your carton wisely, Kantor says. Unlike regular milk, many of these milks are sweetened, so it\\'s important to pick unsweetened varieties to avoid sugar that could eat away at your teeth. Secondly, calcium is important because it gives our teeth strength and shape, as Harvard Health reports. Almonds also have calcium, and most nondairy milks are calcium fortified to include it. However, Healthline advises to looking for milks that have at least 120 milligrams of calcium per 3.4 fluid ounces to make sure you\\'re getting what your body needs.
